# StudyStream  
**Structure First. Clarity Always.**

StudyStream is a hybrid academic productivity system designed to reduce student overwhelm by combining structured digital task management with always-visible physical planning.

## The Problem

Students are not failing due to lack of effort.  
They are overwhelmed by fragmentation.

Assignments, announcements, work schedules, and personal commitments are scattered across multiple systems. Deadlines are visible, but execution paths are not. This leads to overload, procrastination, and last-minute crisis cycles.

## The Solution

StudyStream moves beyond traditional task lists by:

- Breaking large assignments into actionable steps  
- Scheduling work time, not just due dates  
- Detecting conflicts and workload density early  
- Integrating school, work, and life into one unified system  
- Making planning physically visible through a synced digital wall display  

## Why It Matters

StudyStream:

- Reduces academic overwhelm  
- Supports executive function  
- Prevents last-minute stress cycles  
- Turns chaos into clarity  

StudyStream is more than a task manager.  
It is a structured system designed to guide students from planning to graduation.
